Technologies and Libraries Used:

Python 3.11+

OpenCV for image capture and processing

MediaPipe for real-time hand tracking

PyAutoGUI for simulating keyboard inputs

Key Features:

Raise 5 fingers to accelerate the vehicle (presses ‘up arrow’ key)

Close all fingers to brake or balance (presses ‘down arrow’ key)

Minimal latency with built-in gesture cooldown to avoid misfires

Fully customizable to integrate with any desktop-based keyboard game

This project demonstrates how computer vision and gesture recognition can be applied to build intuitive HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) systems, offering alternative control methods beyond traditional devices like keyboards or gamepads.
